# Holberton School Low-Level Programming

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises completed as part of the Holberton School curriculum for Low-Level Programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the fundamentals of the C programming language.
- Learning about pointers and how to use them effectively.
- Working with arrays and strings.
- Gaining a deeper understanding of memory management and memory layout.
- Writing C code following the Betty coding style.

## Project and Exercise List

Here is a list of the projects and exercises completed as part of this curriculum:

1. [**98 Battery st.**](./0-reset_to_98.c)
   - **Description**: A function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.

2. [**Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**](./1-swap.c)
   - **Description**: A function that swaps the values of two integers.

3. [**This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**](./2-strlen.c)
   - **Description**: A function that returns the length of a string.

4. [**I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**](./3-puts.c)
   - **Description**: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

5. [**I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**](./4-print_rev.c)
   - **Description**: A function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.

6. [**Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**](./5-rev_string.c)
   - **Description**: A function that reverses a string.

7. [**Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**](./6-puts2.c)
   - **Description**: A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

8. [**Arrays are not pointers**](./7-puts_half.c)
   - **Description**: A function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

9. [**strcpy**](./8-print_array.c)
   - **Description**: A function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

10. [**Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers**](./9-strcpy.c)
    - **Description**: A function that copies a string, including the terminating null byte (\0), to another buffer.

11. [**atoi**](./100-atoi.c)
    - **Description**: A function that converts a string to an integer, handling signs and special cases.

## Requirements

- Code is written in C and is compiled with `gcc`.
- Compilation options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- No global variables are used.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The Betty coding style is followed.
- The standard library is not used except for specific cases where allowed.

## Project Structure

Each project or exercise is organized in its respective directory, and it typically contains the following files:

- `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `.c` files: Source code files with the implementation of the functions.
- `main.c` (example): A sample main file to test the functions.
- `README.md`: Description and explanation of the project or exercise.
