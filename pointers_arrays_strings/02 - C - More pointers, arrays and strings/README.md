## Requirements

- Code is written in C and is compiled with `gcc`.
- Compilation options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- No global variables are used.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The Betty coding style is followed.
- The standard library is not used except for specific cases where allowed.

## Project Structure

Each project or exercise is organized in its respective directory, and it typically contains the following files:

- `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `.c` files: Source code files with the implementation of the functions.
- `main.c` (example): A sample main file to test the functions.
- `README.md`: Description and explanation of the project or exercise.
